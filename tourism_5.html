<p class="main_body">Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and a royal residence. It is located in <br>Mysore, Karnataka, India. It used to be the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The <br>palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of the <br>Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one. However, the Mysore Palace refers specifically to the one within the <br>new fort.<br>
The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel"). The first palace inside the Old Fort <br>was built in the 14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple times. The Old Fort was built of wood and thus <br>easily caught fire, while the current fort was built of stone, bricks and wood. The current structure was constructed between <br>1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burnt down, the current structure is also known as the New Fort. Mysore Palace is one of the <br>most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than three million annual visitors as on 2014.[1]<br>

The last palace, now known as the Old Palace or the Wooden Palace, burned to ashes during the wedding of Jayalakshammani, the<br> eldest<br> daughter of Chamaraja Wodeyar in 1896. Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV and his mother Maharani Kempananjammanni Devi <br>commissioned the British architect Henry Irwin to build a new palace<br>
